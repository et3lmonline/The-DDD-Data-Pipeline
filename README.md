# The DDD Data Pipelines

As in software development, where the DDD approach is used, I wanted to design a data pipeline with the same name—The DDD Data Pipeline—where each **`D`** represents a framework that contributes to the final project.

The DDD Data Pipelines leverage these frameworks:
- **dlt**: for Extract/Load (EL) in ETL workflows.
- **dbt**: for data transformation using SQL.
- **Dagster**: for orchestration.
- Other `D`s
  - **DuckDB**: an in-memory OLAP database.
  - **Docker**: for containerization.
